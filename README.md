_A curated, community‑driven collection of publicly shared PDF resources on cybersecurity, digital forensics, threat intelligence, governance, risk & compliance, and adjacent fields._

## 1.  Purpose
The goal of **Security Library** is to act as a single, searchable “bookshelf” for learners and practitioners.  
Instead of digging through social‑media timelines, you can:

* clone the repo,
* grep/ripgrep titles, or
* browse the `_pdf/` directory tree grouped by topic.

All files are preserved exactly as originally published; no content is altered.

## 2.  Repository Layout

For now - _pdf/ # The documents themselves (read‑only)

---

## 3.  Usage

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your‑org>/Security_Library.git
   cd Security_Library/_pdf
   rg "Kerberos delegation"      # quickly find documents mentioning the term
```
